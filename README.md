# MARIAM---A-chatbot-for-farmers-
Most farmers in India are generally not scientifically educated regarding crops they grow and the practices they follow. Nowadays, whenever a farmer faces any problems regarding their produce, they trust their local sources or hearsay. These solutions are generally not very trusted and farmers incur loss on their produce. The problem that this project will be trying to solve is the same. The model shall take data related to agriculture from Wikipedia and process it to generate proper response for farmer queries. The model shall be scalable and can also be used for application in other domains.
